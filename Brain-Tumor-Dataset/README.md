# About Brain MRI Dataset

- This brain tumor dataset containing 3064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images from 233 patients with three kinds of brain tumor:  
  |Sr. No | Tumor Name | Number of Observations |
  |:-----:|------------|:----------------------:|  
  | 1 | Meningioma | 708 |  
  | 2 | Glioma | 1426 |
  | 3 | Pituitary Tumor | 930 |

- This dataset is organized in MATLAB data format (`.mat` file) which is one of the data-exchange format by MATLAB. Each file stores a `struct` containing the following fields for an image:

```text
cjdata.label: 1 for meningioma, 2 for glioma, 3 for pituitary tumor
cjdata.PID: patient ID
cjdata.image: image data
cjdata.tumorBorder: a vector storing the coordinates of discrete points on tumor border.
		For example, [x1, y1, x2, y2,...] in which x1, y1 are planar coordinates on tumor border.
		It was generated by manually delineating the tumor border. So we can use it to generate
		binary image of tumor mask.
cjdata.tumorMask: a binary image with 1s indicating tumor region
```

- The jupyter notebook i.e. [`preprocessing_mat_files.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/strikersps/Brain-MRI-Image-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Brain-Tumor-Dataset/preprocessing_mat_files.ipynb) is also provided which consist of python code to extract the information using `h5py` library which provide a `File` class to open and process `.mat` files.
- The following function is written to process the `.mat` file and extract the different information which is stored in an instance of a `File` class of `h5py` library which has a dictionary kind of format. The rest of source-code is just for exporting the images into the required repository after image data is being extracted from the `.mat` file using the following function.

```python
def mat_file_to_dict(filepath: str) -> dict:
	tumor_class = {1: 'meningioma', 2: 'glioma', 3: 'pituitary_tumor'}
	tumor_data_dict = {}
	with h5py.File(filepath, mode = 'r') as image_data:
		cjdata_struct = image_data['cjdata']
		tumor_data_dict['class'] = tumor_class[int(cjdata_struct['label'][0, 0])]
		tumor_data_dict['image'] = cjdata_struct['image'][:].transpose()
		tumor_data_dict['tumor_border'] = cjdata_struct['tumorBorder'][0]
		tumor_data_dict['tumor_mask'] = cjdata_struct['tumorMask'][:].transpose()
	return tumor_data_dict
```
